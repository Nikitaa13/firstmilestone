## Testing and Validation Tools Used
To ensure the quality, performance, and accessibility of the website, we utilized a combination of industry-standard tools for testing and validation. Here is an overview of the tools used:

W3C HTML Validator The W3C HTML Validator is a tool provided by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that helps ensure web pages follow HTML standards. It checks for syntax errors, missing tags, incorrect nesting, and other common issues that may affect the page’s structure and functionality. This tool is crucial for ensuring that the HTML code is both valid and semantically correct.

## Jigsaw 
Jigsaw is another tool provided by W3C, primarily used for testing the markup structure of web pages. It is similar to the W3C Validator but can offer more detailed insights into various markup and accessibility issues. The tool also highlights areas where the page structure deviates from established best practices.
